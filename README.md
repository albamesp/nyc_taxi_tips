# nyc_taxi_tips
This is the repository for the nyc-taxi trips dataset.
The tasks of this exercise were the following:

- Data exploration and cleaning
- Data summary
- Model Building

The three tasks are addressed in the self-explicative notebooks (Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3, respectively).

This repository also contains the pickle of my regressor model and a set of auxiliary functions used in this exercise.
